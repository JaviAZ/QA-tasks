Redirecting standard output/error/input
	command > file 				output result from command into file (overwrites)
	command >> file 			output result from command into file (appends)
	command 2> file 			output result from command into file (only if error is thrown)
	command < file 				input filename into command, command then looks for file (end with ^D)
	command << result			user input that ends with the name called "result", only shown temporary
	who | tee -a wholist | wc -l 	output "who" result into file "wholist" as well as piping to wc -l
